# Conway's Game of Life on torus surface

This game's universe, like in a standard game of life, is two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. But in this case, surface is closed - left edge is connected to right one; top edge is connected to bottom one - torus-like surface.

## How to use

Clone repository to your local machine and go into game-of-life-on-torus directory.
